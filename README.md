# Observatory
My personal Arch Linux build project.

## General

This repository contains all the relevant information to deploy the Arch Linux build that I'm working on, including relevant links to downloads, manpages etc. to serve as a record of the process, to teach me Git, and to serve as a guide to anyone that might want to replicate my build. Right now I'm deploying onto a Lenovo N22 laptop, and am going to try and set up an SD card with the full build on it as well.

## Installation

To get started follow the Arch installation guide at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide
