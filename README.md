# Observatory
My personal Arch Linux build project.

## General

This repository contains all the relevant information to deploy the Arch Linux build that I'm working on, including relevant links to downloads, manpages etc. to serve as a record of the process, to teach me Git, and to serve as a guide to anyone that might want to replicate my build.
